            A croissant is a buttery, flaky, viennoiserie pastry inspired by the
            shape of the Austrian

            but using the French yeast-leavened laminated dough. Croissants are
            named for their historical crescent shape.

            The dough is layered with butter, Rolled and folded several times in
            succession, then rolled into a thin sheet, in a technique called
            laminating. The process results in a layered, flaky texture, similar
            to a puff pastry.

            Crescent-shaped breads have been made since the Renaissance, and
            crescent-shaped cakes possibly since antiquity. Kipferls have long
            been a staple of Austrian, and French bakeries and pâtisseries. The
            modern croissant was developed in the early 20th century when French
            bakers replaced the brioche dough of the kipferl with a
            yeast-leavened laminated dough.

            In the late 1970s, the development of factory-made, frozen,
            preformed but unbaked dough made them into a fast food that could be
            freshly baked by unskilled labor. The croissant bakery, notably the
            La Croissanterie chain, was a French response to American-style fast
            food, and as of 2008, 30–40% of the croissants sold in French
            bakeries and patisseries were baked from frozen dough.

            Croissants are a common part of a continental breakfast in many
            European countries.
